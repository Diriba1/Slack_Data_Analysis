And therefore the Aluminis advice might not be applicable to some and might be even bottom line impossible for others. And therefore I would like to recommend to you based on my imperceptible wisdom to have your own schedule at the beginning of the week. Take a look at that week's challenge doc. see what we are supposed to deliver (on the deliverables section) and after you understand what we need to complete and by when you then plan out the week. Now I think the most important part about the schedule is following it, you might not complete everything on time, and you might finish some before the allotted time frame ends, But for the unfinished tasks don't waste too much unscheduled time on them, as they will definitely take up the other tasks time. So by planning and following your schedule even if you don't complete everything you might manage to get lots done.\n\nLast but not least, don't forget other areas of your life in the meantime. Everyday balance is very necessary and is definitely, at least for me, what constitutes the good life.\n\nGood luck, and Godspeed!","sender_name":"Travis Butler","msg_sent_time":1661428819021,"msg_dist_type":"text","time_thread_start":"1661426750.680949","reply_count":0,"reply_users_count":0,"reply_users":[],"tm_thread_end":0,"channel_name":"all-week1","channel":"anonymized","mention_count":0,"reaction_count":0,"message_count":1,"time_to_first_reply":-1661428819.021848917,"time_of_day":12.0}

{"msg_type":"message","msg_content":"OK here goes\n\n1. Is to actually know or plan what you want to visualize or show on your dashboard. Usually, almost all the things I did for myself.\n2. Next, you install stream lit or your desired mode of visualizer modules like Heroku. I prefer stream lit because I never really worked with Heroku.\n3. After installing everything, you then use all your pre-written scripts here for your advantage. Meaning you can directly use all the methods and helper functions you have already written for your dashboard demonstration. Especially all your data visualization scripts.\n4. Then you will create a python file or files containing the streamlit module to do the dashboard. At this point, it all comes to using the streamlit module to make and show your dashboard. You don't have to exactly show each and everything as you did in your notebook. You can make many other kinds of visualization in streamlit.\n5. Finally, after you completed what you want to show using your python file or files, you then can just use the official streamlit website to host your demonstrations publicly.\nHere are some reference links\n1. Getting started with streamlit. <https:\/\/docs.streamlit.io\/library\/get-started>\n2. Hosting apps to streamlit. <https:\/\/docs.streamlit.io\/streamlit-cloud\/get-started\/deploy-an-app>\nI hope this helps. Try and look over the two resources.
